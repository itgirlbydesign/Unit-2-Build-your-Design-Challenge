<h1> Build Your Design Challenge</h1>
<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
<p>The two websites I was inspired most by was <a href=http://dragone.com/en" target="_blank">Dragone</a> that showcases a performing arts group, and <a href="http://cadrenyc.com/" target="_blank"> Cadre Design Group</a> which is a  web design agency's website, that I feel is really well laid out and intuitive to use. </p>

<h2> How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>
<p>I think the Cadre design group does an excellent job at use of space, without overwhelming or distracting the website user. The information is bold yet simplistically presented in vertical column format, keeping a nice visual balance. Additionally, their logo is located top right, which maintains an intuitive user feel to the website, with information reading left to right, in a western format.When I visit a web page my eyes often go toward the top left for navigation of site, for a toolbar. This website chose to make the menu of website on the right side, as a subtle pop out. This worked well I believe because it followed a clear horizontal line of site from company logo to the menu. Other small features that helped attract my eyes towards menu, were subtle features enhancing visual design elements like flow: when you moved across the page's images, hovering with your mouse, the focal image is highlighted, keeping your attention on 1 image and text at a time. </p>

<p>For the Betterment website,I think negative space of a darker blue was used wisely to accentuate their company logo, navigation, and heading line. As you continue to scroll down the page, you notice the negative space color changes from blue, to white, to light blue, etc creating essentially a one table view of entire site, and a very clean, even-weight balance of the page's different elements. This is a smart way to keep your user's eye focused on each focal point per row. What I also particularly liked on this website, was the animated "parallax" style it was done in. As you go down the page, your eyes are carried to each focal point with an animated mechanic cog image in backround that changes colors the further down page you go.</p>

<h2>What makes the websites similar different? </h2>
<p> What makes both of these websites similar is their visual balance, and use of negative space. Both websites balance their elements in either a row or column set up, both not using blank white space backgrounds,but rather large images or different color blocks as their negative space. They both keep their logos on top left corner of page, keeping in tradition with most websites, and catering to western readers. I think one difference between Cadre's website and betterment's, is in the design: Cadre's website is more visual, and requires more interaction from user. The menu for example in not static to page but rather a pop out from top right corner, with an overall more subdued color scheme of Grey's and white throughout the site.  </p>
